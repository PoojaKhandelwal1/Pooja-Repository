Question 2: lightning connector: The wording of this question was kind of strange and I had to read the text several times, and still did’t get how answers and question would match. The fact is that you have to specify an URL (text field), and you have to press the “validate and sync” to make the data available. In order to make the results searchable you have to choose the “include in Salesforce searches field”. So in other words there are 3 candidates for correct answer (URL, Search index and Button), while the other answers are nonsense. However, only 2 correct answers expected, and it depends on the exact wording/answer phrase which one is correct. Please read the question carefully and make the choice according to the exact wording. For example, if the question is “which data do you have to enter” then you can’t choose the button as a correct answer, because this is no data entry and “URL” is a good answer. If the question is “what do you have to do before you can use the data” and the answers are “URL”, “include in search fields” and “press validate and sync” then the anser “URL” is kind of strange. The next one who takes this exam please give feedback on the exact wording.

Question 5: Answer a) is wrong because Visualforce can only be added into a lightning component, not directly into a lightning page. Lightning components can embed fliter lists, recent items, rich text, visualforce and report charts. A lightning page (built by the app builder) contains lightning components and global actions. A lightning page is what you build with the app builder. Instead of adding a component into a lightning page, components with the force:appHostable interface can be directly integrated into lightning compontent tabs, same like visualforce can be integrated into visualforce tabs, with “available for Salesforce mobile apps”. Winter 16 with lightning experience is adding much more possiblieites to this- the developer console can be used to develop lightning x apps and components with the aura framework:

lightningComponentDevelopment

Question 8: relationship: correct is b) but it depends on the exact wording. If they ask for field type, then b) is correct. If they ask for relationship type then a) would be correct.

Question 9,10: indexes: SOSL uses name, phone, text for search. Some standard picklists seem to be included in search, but generally picklists are not. (maybe via support, I didn’t elaborate on this). External Id (index) can be created on text, number and email. Phone is not an external Id field. SOSL does not work on multi-picklist.

Question 13: see https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=notes_on_changing_custom_field_types.htm&language=en_US the online help is not very precise when it comes to conversion of number, percentage and currency into each other. When multi currency is enabled and you convert currency into number (of same format), you loose the currency information. If you convert the other way you won’t. A simple number to currency conversion with identical field length does not loose information.

Converting a text field of more than 30 characters into autonumber is not possible
