A.) Apex Triggers:
	1.) Use triggers to perform tasks that canâ€™t be done by using the point-and-click tools in the Salesforce user interface. 
	For example, if validating a field value or updating a field on a record, use validation rules and workflow rules instead.
	 
	2.) Triggers are active by default when created.
	
	3.) Syntax:
			trigger TriggerName on ObjectName (trigger_events) {
			   code_block
			}
			
			The events you can specify are:
				before insert
				before update
				before delete
				after insert
				after update
				after delete
				after undelete

				
				
				
				
Extra:
1.) Debug log: create, edit, open, view
